# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a simple "zero-player" game played on an othoganal grid of square cells. It only has four rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Inherit in these rules is that they all happen concurrently on an infinite grid.
